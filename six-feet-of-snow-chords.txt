Six feet of snow coming through my radio
C               D              G          C       D     G
It's raining in stilettos from here clear down to Mex-i-co
G                D         G               C
My hands they're numb from hanging on that steering wheel
C              D           G              C               D       G         
They're frozen tight, hope the wind don't blow me off the road tonight
C                  D       G       C           D          G
Don't you know the ice and snow is sneaking in through my windows
C                  D              Em     C
Don't you know how much I hate to be so cold and so alone

I'm coming home

D
If it wasn't for the lines that wind side by side
D       						
I'd be lying next to her, next to her tonight
